# Lazy project
Mini lightweight dependency injection / invertion of controle library like Spring

`Lazy Project` is a library for Java EE environment similar to spring focusing on reducing the memory footprint.  It has most of the features i used in the project i worked for and the ones you would expect from a java EE library.

The library was designed from the ground with 2 key goals: reducing the memory used by the library and the application it uses and to make it very similar to existing solution in java EE and use many part of Java EE APIs so the switching and transition would be easy for me.

you can see it as my owm implementation of some Java EE features i use.
it's not a production ready project but you can use it as starting point maybe to provide your own implementation or library.
